"Write this message in a founder-to-founder style that's warm and conversational, like you're talking to a peer over coffee. Keep it professional but relaxed - use contractions, shorter sentences, and natural phrasing. Show genuine empathy but avoid being overly formal or corporate. Think startup culture, not corporate boardroom."
